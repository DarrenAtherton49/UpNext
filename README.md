An Android app to track your favourite movies and TV shows.

<img src="screenshots/phone-movies.png" height="375"/>

## Getting Started
To run the app, you will need to add your own [TMDB API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) 
to the project as a property in your local `gradle.properties` file in the format:
```
tmdb_api_key="your_api_key"
```

## Features
- Browse movies and TV shows and add them to your watchlist, custom lists and mark them as 'watched'.
- No sign-in required.
- Works offline via caching, including past searches.

## Backlog
The project backlog is currently split into phases:
1. [Alpha](https://github.com/DarrenAtherton49/UpNext/projects/3)
2. [Beta](https://github.com/DarrenAtherton49/UpNext/projects/5)
