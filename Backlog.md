### Backlog

- Add genres tab to the discover screen tabs to easily look at genre (as well as in the advanced filter)
- The 'up next'/'watchlist' should be 'one click' to mark the next episode as 'watched'. So you should see the episode you're currently on, be able to click 'watched' and the next episode should come up. Also add 'undo' snackbar for this action for accidental clicks.
- Ability to reorder the movie/tv/person details screen sections in the recyclerview from the settings.
- Add setting for default source of rating (e.g. IMDB, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or combined) in places where there is only room to show one score (e.g. in grids).
- Add ability to follow a person as well as a tv show and movie so you can go through and watch someone's filmography.
- Light, dark and black themes
- Link to TMDB, IMDB, Trakt, Amazon etc.
- Trakt syncing
- TMDB list syncing
- Access a gallery of posters and backdrops (these are on TMDB as a separate request)
- Recommendations
- Update the grid/list pages to show which content you have already watched without clicking into the detail screen
- Accessibility, content descriptions etc.
- Add button to mark 'all episodes before this one' as watched
- TMDB discussions
- Custom lists based on filters. Could be used for stuff like dvd collection etc.
- Ability to save searches
- Gamification/stats/achievements
- Deep linking and sharing tv shows, movies and people
- Backup/import - manual and auto with Google Drive
- Display TMDB attribution
- Advanced filters. E.g. by genre
- 'top/featured' result on the search screen - different viewholder (full width) for the first item
- Ability to add missing movies (e.g. random videos that aren't in the database)
- Change detail screen overview maxLines to about 3/4 and add a 'show more' button
- Hide bottom navigation when keyboard is open and show when keyboard is closed. We could do this by sending a view effect to the MainActivity whenever we know the keyboard will be opened and hide the bottom naviation menu from the main activity.
- Add transitions for fragments, e.g. slide up when entering
- Cut down all data models I don't use to decrease memory footprint
- Watch videos on app performance and tune everything
- Look at GrowthJournal backlog for release checklists etc
- Proguard
- Look at TMDB 'changes' api calls - could incorporate this into caching
