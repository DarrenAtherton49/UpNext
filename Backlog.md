### Backlog

- The 'up next'/'watchlist' should be 'one click' to mark the next episode as 'watched'. So you should see the episode you're currently on, be able to click 'watched' and the next episode should come up. Also add 'undo' snackbar for this action for accidental clicks.
- Add setting for default source of rating (e.g. IMDB, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes or combined) in places where there is only room to show one score (e.g. in grids).
- Add ability to follow a person as well as a tv show and movie so you can go through and watch someone's filmography.
- Light, dark and black themes
- Link to TMDB, IMDB, Trakt, Amazon etc.
- Trakt syncing
- TMDB list syncing
- Trailers
- Access a gallery of posters and backdrops (these are on TMDB as a separate request)
- Recommendations
- Update the grid/list pages to show which content you have already watched without clicking into the detail screen
- Accessibility
- Add button to mark 'all episodes before this one' as watched
- TMDB discussions
- Custom lists based on filters. Could be used for stuff like dvd collection etc.
- Gamification/stats/achievements
- Deep linking and sharing
- Backup/import - manual and auto with Google Drive
- Display TMDB attribution
- Advanced filters. E.g. by genre
- 'top/featured' result on the search screen - different viewholder (full width) for the first item
- Ability to add missing movies (e.g. random videos that aren't in the database)
- Change detail screen overview maxLines to about 3/4 and add a 'show more' button
- Hide bottom navigation when keyboard is open and show when keyboard is closed. We could do this by sending a view effect to the MainActivity whenever we know the keyboard will be opened and hide the bottom naviation menu from the main activity.
